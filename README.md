# Pokedex-Webapp

Advanced Frontend Development Concept
 
In this assignment I built a Pokedex web application that shows you various data. Using the pokeapi and the backbone framework in cooperation with underscore js I made several views that loaded data from the api. By selecting one of the types in the first view you get a list of the pokemon that belong to that type in the next view. When you click the detail link you will see various data concerning the chosen pokemon including api properties like height, weight moves and scale.
